On 2022, I decided to give myself the opportunity to teach myself doing the [teach yourself computer science](https://teachyourselfcs.com) guide, and started with the [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs: JavaScript Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262543230) book.

In this repository, I'll be uploading my reading notes and exercises answers.
